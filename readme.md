# Frontend Boilerplate

Write frontend apps the way Rick Carlino does! This is just some boilerplate I am stowing away for the time being.

## Stuff I'm using

 * Bower (within app/scripts/vendor)
 * Jasmine (spec runner at `app/test.html`)
 * RequireJS (see main.js)
 * LoDash AMD
 * Zurb Foundation
